This Java-based Tag Cloud Generator processes a text file and produces an HTML page displaying the top N most frequent words as a visual tag cloud. The program reads user-specified input and output file paths, counts word occurrences using Maps, and sorts them using SortingMachines by frequency and alphabetically. Each word is displayed with a font size proportional to its frequency, enabling quick visual identification of dominant terms. The project emphasizes component-based design, use of custom comparators, and strict adherence to Java standards for input/output and data structures.
